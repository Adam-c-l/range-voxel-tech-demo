A 3x3 grid-based block placement system designed for building machines and managing an advanced item and machine progression system. Built with the **Range Engine**, this project demonstrates precise block placement mechanics alongside a tech tree for unlocking increasingly complex machines and items.

When a block is placed, the system checks whether the surrounding configuration matches any predefined machine blueprint. This check is **localized**: it only runs when a block is placed, and only around that specific block. This makes the system **modular, performant**, and **scalable**â€”ideal for large or infinite worlds.

Since detection always begins from the newly placed block, **rotations are naturally supported**. The system can identify valid machines in any orientation without needing to scan the full grid, making rotation handling **simple and efficient**.
